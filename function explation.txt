socket.AF_INET:stands for "Address Family Internet" and refers to the Internet Protocol v4 (IPv4) address family. This means that the socket can use IPv4 addresses, such as '127.0.0.1' or '192.168.0.1'
SOCK_STREAM is used for TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connections, which are reliable and provide a stream of bytes. This means that data is sent in chunks, and if any chunks are lost or arrive out of order, the receiver can request that they be re-sent.
The recv() method is used to receive data from a socket and is commonly used in server-side programs. The method takes a single argument, which is the number of bytes to receive. In this case, the argument is 1024, meaning that the method will receive up to 1024 bytes of data from the socket.
