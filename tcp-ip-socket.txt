2-/problems with direct connection
  . it difficult to get ip address 
  . even if we get his ip address the ip address is dynamic ip so its always changing
  .even we could get regular updates to the dynamic ip address the computer has bunch of firewalls which make it 
    possible to get  to his computer.
  . revers connection.
3-/ server 
  .remote computer when you can store files or host websites
  .it has a static ip address 
  . we need internet to access this remote computer

4-/ reverse shell 
 . we need connect a cloud server with victim host 
  2 file we make it 
   client.py is programme installed on client host 
   server.py is programme installed on server 
 ===> to make revers shell
